# OpenPower Firmware Documentation #

This repository will contain all documentation for the [OpenPower](http://openpowerfoundation.org/) open source software
that's being released to support the POWER ecosystem.

As always is the case with documentation, it usually needs some updates.  So feel free to do it yourself :) or touch
base with us on the mailing lists.

It is recommended that you first read the [Hostboot Programmers
Guide](https://github.com/open-power/docs/blob/master/hostboot/HostBoot_PG.md) and the [OCC Overview](https://github.com/open-power/docs/blob/master/occ/OCC_overview.md) and see the code structure overview and videos shown at the [OpenPower build repo](https://open-power.github.io/op-build/).  These documents will give you an
overview of the OCC, Hostboot firmware and some pointers on the source code. 

# OpenPOWER Hardware Documentation #
Details on POWER8 and POWER9 hardware designs can be found at the [IBM Portal for OpenPOWER](https://www.ibm.com/systems/power/openpower/welcome.xhtml).
