Petitboot Plugins
=================

DRAFT

This specification is for plugins to the Petitboot Bootloader environment.

The petitboot bootloader is part of the OpenPower firmware stack.

This document describes what plugin authors can expect, what is explicitly
supported and what is explicitly *not* supported.

Authors
-------
Initial Specification Draft: Stewart Smith <stewart@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
Reference implementation of Petitboot Plugin: Jeremy Kerr <jk@ozlabs.org>

Availability
------------
The first op-build release to support petitboot plugins is v1.7 (released
September 2015). Refer to individual firmware vendor's release notes to
find minimal firmware versions for shipping machines.

Prior versions of OPAL firmware do *not* support petitboot plugins of any
type.

Goal
----

To allow vendors to provide various userspace tools and utilities for
execution within the petitboot environment.

For example: configuration utilities for RAID cards.

Petitboot plugins are not meant to solve all of the possible problems,
sometimes providing a bootable image may be preferable to a petitboot
plugin.

Implementation
--------------
See petitboot/utils/pb-plugin source for the reference implementation.

File format
-----------

Petitboot plugins are a gzip compressed cpio archive ending in ".pb-plugin".

Within this archive, there MUST exist a etc/preboot-plugins/pb-plugin.conf
file (see pb-plugin.conf definition below).

As of petitboot plugin ABI version 1, the etc/preboot-plugins/ directory
is reserved and MUST NOT contain any files other than pb-plugin.conf

The archive will be extracted and run in a chroot-like environment, so it
is RECOMMENDED that plugins follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, although
this is not REQUIRED. The intention is to isolate the plugin from both other
plugins and the petitboot environment itself.

The following paths MAY exist but the petitboot environment MAY (and indeed,
in the current implementation WILL) mount filesystems over them:
- dev
- sys
- proc
- var

The petitboot environment WILL create the mountpoints if nedeed.
The petitboot environment WILL create/replace the plugin's etc/resolv.conf

See Plugin ABI section.

Petitboot plugin location
-------------------------
The petitboot environment MAY support discovery of plugins. It will search
ONLY in the root directory of accessible file systems.

Petitboot plugins MAY be installed from other locations, possibly even over
the network.

pb-plugin.def contents
----------------------
This file tells petitboot about the plugin.

Within the petitboot plugin, it is found at etc/preboot-plugins/pb-plugin.conf

Within this file, there MUST exist the following key/value pairs with the format
KEY=VALUE :

PLUGIN_ABI
PLUGIN_ABI_MIN
PLUGIN_VENDOR
PLUGIN_VENDOR_ID
PLUGIN_NAME
PLUGIN_ID
PLUGIN_VERSION
PLUGIN_DATE
PLUGIN_EXECUTABLES

Values MAY be quoted. The pb-plugin.conf file is NOT executed shell and must
not be treated as such.

Example:
PLUGIN_ABI='1'
PLUGIN_ABI_MIN='1'
PLUGIN_VENDOR='OpenPower Foundation'
PLUGIN_VENDOR_ID='OpenPower'
PLUGIN_NAME='Hello World Petitboot Plugin Example 1'
PLUGIN_ID='Hello World'
PLUGIN_VERSION='1.0'
PLUGIN_DATE='2015-09-16'
PLUGIN_EXECUTABLES='/usr/bin/hello-world'

In the future, additional variables may be added, but these ones MUST ALWAYS
exist. This allows any future incompatible change to gracefully fail, telling
the user about the presence of a plugin that cannot be run.

The following restrictions apply:
- PLUGIN_ABI and PLUGIN_ABI_MIN must be numeric (0-9+)
- PLUGIN_ID and PLUGIN_VENDOR_ID should only contain lowercase alphanumerics
  and hyphens
- PLUGIN_DATE *MUST* be in the format YYYY-MM-DD
  The format MM/DD/YY is EXPLICITLY NOT SUPPORTED or encouraged. Anywhere. Ever.

TODO: clarify UTF8 support in these fields

Each executable in PLUGIN_EXECUTABLES *SHOULD* be a unique name. Since the
petitboot environment creates a wrapper script to execute the plugin from the
petitboot environment, installing two plugins with the same executable name
WILL conflict, with whatever plugin was installed most recently winning.

It is thus RECOMMENDED that you name executables along the lines of
'openpower-hello-world' rather than just 'hello-world' so as not to conflict
with a possible 'acme-hello-world'.

Plugin ABI versioning
---------------------

The Petitboot environment will support a petitboot plugin ABI version.
Each petitboot plugin has a minimal ABI version it supports running.

If the petitboot plugin's ABI version is GREATER than the petitboot
environment's, the plugin MUST NOT be run.

A plugin is OK to run if:
1. the plugin's ABI matches the petitboot environment's ABI, or
2. the plugin's minimum ABI is lower than or equal to the petitboot
   enviornement's ABI

Plugin ABI
----------
The Petitboot environment provides the following ABI to plugins:
- Linux kernel ppc64el ABI
  - with the expectation that executables fail gracefully if certain
    kernel features are not available.
  - depending on optional kernel features is NOT RECOMMENDED.
    For the large part: be sensible. You can expect syscalls as of
    linux 4.2 to exist.
    - Some plugins may REQUIRE certain functionality to be enabled in
      the petitboot kernel (for example: a specific RAID driver).
      It is encouraged to fail gracefully in the absence of this
      driver with an easy to understand error message for the user.

It EXPLICITLY DOES NOT support kernel modules. You MUST NOT include
kernel modules in your plugin. If you require kernel module support,
ship instead a bootable disk rather than a petitboot plugin.

As each plugin executes in its own chroot environment, binaries must
either be statically linked or MUST include ALL dependencies (for example:
dynamic linker, libc, ncurses)

Plugin executables execute as root in the plugin's chroot environment. The
plugin chroot environment is temporary and IS NOT persistent across reboots.
This is implemented in the reference implementation by extracting the
plugin into a ram disk.

The var/ mountpoint inside a plugin chroot environment is a bind mount
of the petitboot environment /var. Be sensible with logging within your
petitboot plugin: don't overwrite petitboot logs, log to a file name unique
to your plugin.

While more than just var/log is exposed to the plugin, it is explictily
NOT SUPPORTED to use the var/ bind mount for anything BUT logging.

It is possible that in a future release, the implementation may change so
that the plugin CANNOT access anything but its own logs in var/ but that
the petitboot environment CAN access the logs of the plugin.
