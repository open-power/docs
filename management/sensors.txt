Sensors on OpenPOWER platforms
==============================

There are a number of sensors defined for OpenPOWER machines - some controlled
by the POWER host, and some controlled by the management controller.

 * "Func" (functional) sensors
    Sensor type: discrete, specific type depends on component
    Set by: hostboot

    These represent whether a component is functional, and are set at boot-time
    by hostboot firmware.

    These are IPMI assertion sensors, complying with the IPMI-defined assertion
    states appropriate to the sensor type.

 * BIOS Golden side & BMC Golden side
   Sensor type: OEM discrete (0xc3)
   Set by: BMC

   Bit 0 (the least-significant bit) indicates golden side boot. 0 = primary
   side, 1 = working side.

 * Boot count
   Sensor type: OEM discrete (0xc3)
   Set by: BMC, OPAL

   The assertion bits (read as a uint8) indicate the boot count value. The BMC
   uses this to detect when the system has failed sucessive boots, and should be
   started in golden-side mode.

 * "Fault" sensors
   Sensor type: OEM discrete (0xc7)
   Set by: hostboot

   The least-significant assertion bit indicates a fault.
 
 * Firmware boot progress
   Sensor type: discrete, System Firmware Progress (0x0f)

   Assertion type. During boot, hostboot and OPAL will update this sensor to one
   of the IPMI-defined progress codes.

 * Turbo allowed
   Sensor type: OEM discrete (0xcb)
   Set by: BMC

   Single-state digital sensor that indicates whether the on-chip controllers
   will allow the host processors to enter turbo mode.

 * System Event
   Sensor type: discrete, System Event (0x61)
   Set by: hostboot

   Will assert an IPMI-specified system failure state.

TODO
----

 * APSS sensor
 * Power/current sensor(s)
 * Quick Power drop sensor
