System Event Logs (SELs) on OpenPOWER platforms
===============================================

OpenPOWER BMCs will record standard IPMI SEL logs, but will typically vary by
BMC implementation. For general system fault monitoring, SEL events logged
against the Fault sensors (see the sensors.txt document) will be raised to
indicate FRU-specific faults.

In addition to these standard SEL events, host firmware may generate the
following types of SELs:

 * SEL type 0xdf: flattened PEL
 * SEL type 0xde: symbolic fru/isolation procedure

These events are also reflected in an eSEL record, which contains extended debug
data for fault analysis
